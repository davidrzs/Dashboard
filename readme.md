## Features

The dashboard can show the following things:

- weather for the next three days
- news from a wide range of sources
- date and time
- temperature or related time series data from a REST-API
- more coming soon..

## Installation and Usage

Coming soon. Since this project is still under active development things will change & break.

## Background of the project

This project has been written to transform an old LCD screen we had lying around our office into a modern dashboard using a RaspberryPi. Despite not containing any tests and having some rough edges, this side project will be maintained by us (and not be left to rot by itself).
